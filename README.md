ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a fraud detection system built on real-world financial transaction data. It covers the complete workflow from data cleaning â†’ feature engineering â†’ model training â†’ evaluation â†’ interpretability.

The model is trained using LightGBM, a gradient boosting algorithm well-suited for highly imbalanced datasets like fraud detection, where fraudulent cases make up less than 0.2% of all transactions.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Source: [Kaggle Dataset â€“ Fraud.csv]

Size: ~6 million rows, 11 features

Key Features:

step â†’ transaction day/time

type â†’ transaction type (TRANSFER, CASH_OUT, etc.)

amount â†’ transaction value

oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrg, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest â†’ account balances before/after transactions

isFraud â†’ target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Legit)

isFlaggedFraud â†’ pre-existing rule-based flag (excluded to prevent leakage)

ðŸ”§ Data Preprocessing
1. Missing Values

Checked with .isnull().sum()

âœ… No missing values found

2. Outliers:

-Large transaction amounts were observed.

-These are valid fraud indicators, not errors â†’ kept in the dataset.

3. Multicollinearity

   -Strong correlation between:

   -oldbalanceOrg â†” newbalanceOrg

   -oldbalanceDest â†” newbalanceDest

Action Taken:

Engineered new features:

#orig_diff = oldbalanceOrg - newbalanceOrg - amount\
#dest_diff = oldbalanceDest - newbalanceDest + amount\
Dropped redundant balance columns to reduce leakage.\

4. Feature Engineering

  Dropped identifiers: nameOrig, nameDest

  Dropped low-signal features: step, isFlaggedFraud

 Encoded categorical feature type into numeric codes
